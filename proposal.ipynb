    "## Analysing Changes in Transportation Modes Before, During, and After COVID-19 in Different Urbanisation Level Areas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group Members:\n",
    "- Splinter Groenink 5170672\n",
    "- Hidde Voogt 5886694\n",
    "- Justin Wagenaar 5088259\n",

    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- **Determine Transport Patterns Before COVID-19**:  \n",
    "  Analyse transportation modes and usage patterns in the Netherlands prior to the pandemic.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Determine Transport Patterns During COVID-19**:  \n",
    "  Examine changes in transportation modes and usage during the pandemic, considering lockdowns and mobility restrictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Determine Transport Patterns After COVID-19**:  \n",
    "  Assess post-pandemic transportation patterns to identify lasting changes in mobility behaviour.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Compare Urban and Rural Areas**:  \n",
    "  Investigate differences in transportation modes used in different urbanisation level areas across the three time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions:\n",
    "#### Primary Question:\n",
    "- What are the differences in transportation modes used in different urbanisation level areas before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Secondary Questions:\n",
    "- How did passenger numbers vary across different transportation modes and periods?\n",
    "- How did passenger kilometres vary across different transportation modes and periods?\n",
    "- How did the number of trips vary across different transportation modes and periods?\n",
    "- Are there regional differences in transport behaviour in response to the pandemic?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources:\n",
    "- **Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS)**:\n",
    "  - **Dataset**: Transport; performance and transport means, 2018-2023\n",
    "  - **Description**: Includes public transportation data covering various modes (e.g., bus, train, tram) and geographical areas over different periods.\n",
    "  - **Link**: CBS Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Scale:\n",
    "- **2018 to 2024**:\n",
    "  - **Before COVID-19**: 2018-2019\n",
    "  - **During COVID-19**: 2020-2021 (from March 2020 onward, there were restrictions in the Netherlands)\n",
    "  - **Transition Period**: 2022 (from May onward, the Netherlands had no restrictions)\n",
    "  - **After COVID-19**: 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Scale:\n",
    "- Based on address density per kmÂ²:\n",
    "  - Extremely urbanised (2500 or more)\n",
    "  - Strongly urbanised (1500-2500)\n",
    "  - Moderately urbanised (1000-1500)\n",
    "  - Hardly urbanised (500-1000)\n",
    "  - Not urbanised (0-500)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Pipeline Overview:\n",
    "- **Data Collection**:  \n",
    "  - Source data from CBS.  \n",
    "  - Ensure all relevant datasets are downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Exploration**:  \n",
    "  - Use exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.  \n",
    "  - Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**:  \n",
    "  - Check for and handle missing or inconsistent data.  \n",
    "  - Validate data accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Transformation**:  \n",
    "  - Perform feature engineering for new variables.  \n",
    "  - Integrate data if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Analysis**:  \n",
    "  - Conduct statistical analysis using Python libraries (SciPy, StatsModels).  \n",
    "  - Visualise trends and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Visualization**:  \n",
    "  - Create plots and charts using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.  \n",
    "  - Develop interactive visualisations if possible."
